List of avaliable geometry generator files for CALIFA
Last update: 29/04/20 (questions to: hector.alvarez@usc.es)

- Macro: create_califa_final_barrel_iphos_geo.C
  CALIFA BARREL + iPHOS (from Nov 2019).
  Most recent version from the CAD drawings from Univ. Vigo.
  It requires the files CLF-ALL-oneCrystal.txt and CLF-ALL-onePart.txt: These files
  include vertex information from the crystals and alveoli.
  It requires a file with a list of included crystals.
    califa_InstalledCrystals_Nov2019.txt for the installed crystals in Nov2019 or
    califa_AllCrystalsIn.txt for all possible crystals in.
    There will be no difference with respect to the analysis, but the simulation
    will only create the alveoli with crystals in the case of the first file.

- Macro: create_califa_2020_s454_geo.C
  Same as before, but with the alignment of experiments
  s454:
  a 2.4 cm displacement of target from nominal (towards SIS) and
  a separation between the two halves of 2.5 cm (1.25 cm each half)


- Macro: create_califa_feb19__geo.C
  Same as before, but with the crystals of the demonstrator and the
  alignment of experiments s444(2019), s454(2019), s473(2019):
  a 2.4 cm displacement of target from nominal (towards SIS) and
  a separation between the two halves of 2.5 cm (1.25 cm each half)
